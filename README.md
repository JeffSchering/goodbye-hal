## Description ##

Daisy, Daisy, I'm half crazy, all for the love of you.

This is not just a Wordpress plugin. It's based on the famous plugin [Hello Dolly](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hello-dolly/) by Matt Mullenweg, and works just like it except that the lyrics are for the song Daisy Bell, which [HAL 9000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000) sang as he was being de-activated in the movie <cite>2001: A Space Odyssey</cite>.

When this plugin is activated, you'll see a random line from the Daisy Bell lyrics in the upper right of your admin screen.

## Daisy Bell Lyrics ##

<pre>There is a flower  
Within my heart,  
Daisy, Daisy!  
Planted one day  
By a glancing dart,  
Planted by Daisy Bell!  
Whether she loves me  
Or loves me not,  
Sometimes it's hard to tell;  
Yet I am longing to share the lot  
Of beautiful Daisy Bell!  

Daisy, Daisy,  
Give me your answer do!  
I'm half crazy,  
All for the love of you!  
It won't be a stylish marriage,  
I can't afford a carriage  
But you'll look sweet upon the seat  
Of a bicycle built for two.  

We will go tandem  
As man and wife,  
Daisy, Daisy!   
'Peddling' away  
Down the road of life,  
I and my Daisy Bell!  
When the road's dark  
We can both despise  
P'licemen and lamps as well;  
There are 'bright lightsâ€™  
In the dazzling eyes  
Of beautiful Daisy Bell!  

Daisy, Daisy,  
Give me your answer do!  
I'm half crazy,  
All for the love of you!  
It won't be a stylish marriage,  
I can't afford a carriage  
But you'll look sweet upon the seat  
Of a bicycle built for two.  

I will stand by you In wheel or woe,  
Daisy, Daisy!  
You'll be the belle  
Which I'll ring you know!  
Sweet little Daisy Bell!  
You'll take the lead  
In each trip we take,   
Then if I don't do well,   
I will permit you to   
Use the brake,   
My beautiful Daisy Bell!  

Daisy, Daisy,  
Give me your answer do!  
I'm half crazy,  
All for the love of you!  
It won't be a stylish marriage,  
I can't afford a carriage,  
But you'll look sweet upon the seat  
Of a bicycle built for two.</pre>
