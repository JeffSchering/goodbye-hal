## Description ##

Daisy, Daisy, I'm half crazy all for the love of you.

This is just a plugin. It works like the famous Hello Dolly plugin, except that the lyrics are for the song Daisy Bell, which [HAL 9000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000) sang as he was being de-activated in the movie <cite>2001: A Space Odyssey</cite>. When this plugin is activated, you'll see a random line from the Daisy Bell lyrics in the upper right of your admin screen.
