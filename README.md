## Description ##

Daisy, Daisy, I'm half crazy, all for the love of you.

This is not just a Wordpress plugin. It's based on the famous plugin [Hello Dolly](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hello-dolly/) by Matt Mullenweg, and works just like it except that the lyrics are for the song Daisy Bell, which [HAL 9000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000) sang as he was being de-activated in the movie <cite>2001: A Space Odyssey</cite>.

When this plugin is activated, you'll see a random line from the Daisy Bell lyrics in the upper right of your admin screen.
